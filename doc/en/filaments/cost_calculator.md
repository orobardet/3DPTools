# Cost calculator

The cost calculator estimates the cost of a 3D print from a given filament, and la quantity of material that will be used for 
printing.

It needs the following information to work:
- Initial quantity of material in the filament spool
- Bought cost (price) of the filament
- Density of the filament's material
- Diameter of the filament

Base of these information, the application is able to compute the price of a length or weight of filament.

# Usage

First, a filament needs to be selected.

The cost calculator page shows in the left side a list of non finished filaments.  
It is possible to filter this list by color, material or brand. 

Once the wanted filament is found, clicking on it is enough to select it.

In the right side of the page appears a summary of some information of the filament, and a form to enter a weight or a 
length of material.

When one of those values is inputed, the application computes the different elements and displays the result below the 
form:
- the weight 
- the length
- the cost
