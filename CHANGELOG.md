## Upgrade notes :

- You need to upgrade your MongoDB version to 3.6. 3DPTools database is compatible without changes:
  - Backup you data (just in case)
  - Upgrade 3DPTools 
  - Stop 3DPTools
  - Upgrade MongoDB to 3.6
  - Restart 3DPTools
  - Although not needed by 3DPTool (for now), it is recommended to enable Mongo's [3.6 feature compatibility](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/setFeatureCompatibilityVersion/)**. 
```javascript
// In a MongoShell as admin:
db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "3.6" } )
```

- Filament name is now optional. You can clean name for all filament where it match the `material name + color name`
 (e.g. `PLA Black`) with:
```shell
bin/cli database patch 110-filament-names-clean
```
Can be run any time on a running instance, after version upgrade.
